/**
 * Our target is to write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 with the following rules:
 *
 * If number is 3 or multiple of 3 should be replaced with 'Fizz'
 * If number is 5 or multiple of 5 should be replaced with 'Buzz'
 * If number is multiple of 3 and 4 should be replaced with 'FizzBuzz'
 *
 * TDD Rules:
 *
 * You can't write any production code until you have first written a failing unit test.
 * You can't write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing.
 * You can't write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing unit test.
