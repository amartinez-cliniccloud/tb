# Leap Year

## The exercise

Our target is to write a program that can tell if a year is leap year or not. You can resolve it writing a function or a class.

Remember the rules:

* If year number is divisible by 4 it is leap year, and we add an extra day at the end of February, but...
* From time to time we need to avoid adding one day to keep the calendar in sync with seasons, so if year number is divisible by 100 then it is not leap year. 
* Also, this introduces a little error, so we compensate it with an extra day every 400 years. When a year number is divisible by 400, then it is leap year.
