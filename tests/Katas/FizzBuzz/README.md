# FizzBuzz

Our target is to write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 with the following rules:

* If number is 3 or multiple of 3 should be replaced with 'Fizz'
* If number is 5 or multiple of 5 should be replaced with 'Buzz'
* If number is multiple of 3 and 5 should be replaced with 'FizzBuzz'

This exercise is pretty good to learn the basics of the TDD classicist approach, and the red-green-refactor cycle. If you are looking for a good kata to start learning PHP, this is one of the best.

Also, it's one of the best kata to learn how to apply the TDD Rules.

## TDD Rules:

* You can't write any production code until you have first written a failing unit test.
* You can't write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing.
* You can't write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing unit test.
